    "prompt": "Merchant A, a manufacturer of widgets, sent a signed letter to Buyer B on January 1st stating: \"We offer to sell you 1,000 widgets at $10 each. This offer will remain open until March 31st.\" Buyer B did not pay anything to keep the offer open. On February 1st, Merchant A called Buyer B and said, \"The price of widgets has gone up. I am revoking my offer of January 1st.\" On February 5th, Buyer B sent a letter accepting the January 1st offer.\nIs there an enforceable contract between Merchant A and Buyer B?",
    "response": "No, there is not an enforceable contract between Merchant A and Buyer B.\n\nHere's the analysis:\n\n1. Firm Offers Under Common Law:\n- At common law, offers can be revoked at any time before acceptance, even if the offeror promises to keep the offer open for a specific period.\n- The exception is if there is \"consideration\" given to keep the offer open (creating an \"option contract\").\n- In this case, Buyer B did not provide any consideration to keep the offer open, so the promise to keep it open until March 31st was not binding.\n\n2. Valid Revocation:\n- Merchant A's phone call on February 1st was a clear and direct communication of revocation to Buyer B.\n- The revocation was communicated before Buyer B attempted to accept the offer.\n- Once an offer is validly revoked, it can no longer be accepted by the offeree.\n\n3. Attempted Acceptance:\n- Buyer B's attempted acceptance on February 5th came after the valid revocation.\n- Since the offer was no longer in existence at the time of the attempted acceptance, no contract could be formed.\n\nNote: If this were a transaction governed by the UCC's firm offer rule (\u00a72-205), the analysis might be different if Merchant A was a merchant and the offer was in writing and signed. However, even under the UCC, a firm offer is only irrevocable for a maximum of 3 months unless supported by consideration.\n\nTherefore, since Merchant A validly revoked the offer before Buyer B's acceptance, no contract was formed.",

Firm Offer Rule:\n- Under common law, offers can be revoked at any time before acceptance unless there is consideration to keep the offer open\n- In this case, Buyer B did not provide any consideration to keep the offer open until March 31st\n- Therefore, the promise to keep the offer open until March 31st is not binding\n\n2. Revocation:\n- Merchant A effectively revoked the offer on February 1st through direct communication to Buyer B\n- The revocation was clear and unambiguous\n- The revocation occurred before Buyer B's attempted acceptance\n\n3. Attempted Acceptance:\n- Buyer B's acceptance on February 5th came after the offer was already revoked\n- Once an offer is revoked, it cannot be accepted\n- Therefore, Buyer B's acceptance was ineffective\n\n4. UCC \u00a7 2-205 Firm Offer Exception:\n- Even under the UCC's firm offer rule, which applies to merchants, a signed writing promising to hold an offer open must be supported by consideration unless the offer explicitly states it will be held open\n- The maximum period for such firm offers under the UCC is three months\n- However, this exception doesn't help Buyer B because there was no consideration\n\nTherefore, since the offer was properly revoked before acceptance, and there was no consideration to keep it open, no contract was formed between Merchant A and Buyer B.",

Firm Offer Rule\n- Under common law, offers can be revoked at any time before acceptance unless there is consideration to keep the offer open\n- In this case, Buyer B did not provide any consideration to keep the offer open until March 31st\n- Therefore, this is not a binding option contract under common law\n\n2. UCC 2-205 (Firm Offer Rule for Merchants)\n- While UCC 2-205 allows merchants to make irrevocable offers in signed writings, even without consideration\n- These firm offers are only binding for a maximum of 3 months, even if a longer period is stated\n- However, the merchant can still revoke the offer before acceptance if they clearly communicate the revocation to the offeree\n\n3. Revocation and Acceptance\n- Merchant A clearly communicated revocation to Buyer B on February 1st\n- Buyer B's acceptance on February 5th came after the valid revocation\n- An acceptance cannot create a contract after an offer has been properly revoked\n\n4. Conclusion\n- Since Merchant A validly revoked the offer before Buyer B's acceptance\n- And there was no consideration to keep the offer open\n- No contract was formed between the parties\n\nTherefore, there is no enforceable contract between Merchant A and Buyer B.",

Attempted Acceptance:\n- Buyer B's attempted acceptance on February 5th came after the valid revocation\n- Once an offer is revoked, any subsequent attempt to accept is ineffective\n- Therefore, no contract was formed\n\n4. Note on UCC 2-205:\n- Even if this were analyzed under the UCC (as it involves the sale of goods), the result would be the same\n- While the UCC does provide for \"firm offers\" by merchants, they are only binding for a maximum of 3 months if in writing and signed\n- However, the offer must explicitly state it is irrevocable to fall under UCC 2-205\n- The facts don't indicate such an explicit statement of irrevocability\n\nTherefore, there is no enforceable contract because Merchant A validly revoked the offer before Buyer B's acceptance.",

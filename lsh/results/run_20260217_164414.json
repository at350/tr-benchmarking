The acknowledgment of receipt in the contract was made under the assumption that the check would clear, which it did not, rendering the acknowledgment potentially incorrect or mistaken.\n\nTherefore, it is plausible that the court would allow the woman to testify regarding the non-payment to show that the receipt of payment was not as straightforward as the written contract suggests, especially given the failure of the check. This testimony would be essential to resolve the factual dispute over whether payment was actually made and could influence the outcome of the lawsuit, particularly regarding remedies such as rescission of the contract or damages for breach of contract."

In this case, the written agreement states that the receipt of $10,000 by the woman is acknowledged, which implies that the payment was made.\n\n2. **Exceptions to the Parol Evidence Rule**: While the parol evidence rule might initially suggest that the woman's testimony about non-payment is inadmissible, there are important exceptions to consider:\n   - **Fraud, Mistake, or Misrepresentation**: If the testimony is being introduced to establish that there was a fraud (e.g., if the man intentionally wrote a bad check knowing there were insufficient funds), or a mistake or misrepresentation regarding the payment, then the testimony could be admissible.\n   - **Incomplete or Ambiguous Contracts**: If the written contract is deemed incomplete or ambiguous regarding the terms of payment, the court might allow external evidence to clarify these terms. However, in this scenario, the contract explicitly acknowledges receipt of payment, which appears unambiguous.\n   - **Subsequent Developments**: The testimony might also be relevant to show a breach of contract (non-payment) that occurred after the contract was signed.\n\n3. **Purpose of the Testimony**: The purpose of the woman's testimony is crucial. If it is to show that the man never paid the money and thus breached the contract, then it is more likely to be considered relevant and not merely an attempt to alter the terms of the written contract.\n\nGiven these considerations, it is likely that the trial court judge will find the woman's testimony admissible. The reason for this is that her testimony does not seek to contradict the written agreement at the time of signing (where the acknowledgment of receipt might be seen as a formal requirement) but rather to establish that the conditions for transaction completion were not fulfilled due to the man's subsequent breach (the bounced check). Thus, while the written instrument states that the money was received, her testimony addresses what happened after this acknowledgment - a critical factor in proving non-payment and potential fraud or breach of contract.\n\nTherefore, the judge would likely overrule the man\u2019s objection, allowing the woman to testify regarding the non-payment to show that the man did not fulfill his contractual obligations."

This clause in the agreement indicates that the parties acknowledge the transaction of the payment as complete in the written contract. The parol evidence rule would typically prevent the woman from testifying about oral statements or agreements that contradict this written acknowledgment of payment.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions to the parol evidence rule that may be relevant in this case. One key exception allows for the introduction of evidence to establish that a fraud, mistake, or other irregularity occurred, which is directly related to the execution of the contract. If the woman's argument is that the acknowledgment of receipt was based on the expectation of a valid check (which is a common and reasonable assumption in transactions), and since the check bounced due to insufficient funds, she might argue that there was a mistake or misrepresentation regarding the actual receipt of funds.\n\nFurthermore, the woman could argue that the written acknowledgment of receipt was conditional upon the check clearing, which did not occur. This brings in the concept of conditional payment where the condition (the check must clear) was not fulfilled.\n\nIf the judge considers these arguments compelling under the exceptions to the parol evidence rule, the judge might overrule the man's objection, allowing the woman to testify that the payment was not actually made as the check was not honored. This would depend heavily on the specifics of jurisdictional law regarding checks as conditional payments and the interpretation of the contract under these circumstances.\n\nThus, whether the judge is correct in sustaining the objection would depend on the interpretation of the parol evidence rule alongside the exceptions applicable under the law, particularly considering any local statutes or case law regarding the handling of bounced checks and conditional payments in contract cases."

The pivotal legal principle here is the application of the parol evidence rule, which generally prohibits the introduction of evidence outside of a written contract that contradicts or modifies the written terms of that contract. However, there are exceptions to this rule that are pertinent in this scenario.\n\nThe written agreement between the woman and the man stated that the payment of $10,000 was \"received,\" which is a standard clause in such sales agreements. However, the factual dispute arises from the fact that the check provided by the man bounced due to insufficient funds, indicating that the woman never actually received the payment.\n\nOne of the exceptions to the parol evidence rule allows for extrinsic evidence (such as the woman's testimony) when there is a question of whether a condition in the contract has been fulfilled. In this case, the condition in question is the payment of $10,000. Since the check bounced, the payment was not completed as per the terms of the contract. Therefore, the woman's testimony is necessary to establish that the condition of payment was not actually met despite the wording in the contract.\n\nMoreover, evidence is generally admissible to show a party's fraud, misrepresentation, or mistake, and in this case, the woman's testimony could potentially point to a mistake regarding the belief that payment had been received or possibly even deceptive behavior on the part of the man if it is shown he knew there were insufficient funds at the time the check was issued.\n\nTherefore, the woman's testimony about the man not having paid her despite the contract stating \"receipt of which is acknowledged\" would likely be deemed admissible to clarify the factual situation and assert her claim that she has not received the payment. Thus, the judge would likely overrule the man's objection allowing the woman to testify that the payment was not actually made."

The parol evidence rule generally bars extrinsic evidence that adds to, contradicts, or modifies a fully integrated writing\u2019s terms.

If needed, the burden can be aided by producing the actual payment instrument (e.g., the canceled check) or bank records, which are the best evidence of whether payment occurred, but the testimony that payment did not occur is itself admissible as proof of breach.\n- The key point is that the recitation \u201creceipt of which is acknowledged\u201d is a recital in the writing, not a bar to proving nonpayment as a matter of breach.

Here, testimony that the buyer did not actually pay the $10,000 would amount to contradicting the deed\u2019s explicit recital that payment was received.\n- There is no recognized exception here (e.g., fraud, mistake, duress, or lack of consideration that would render the contract void/voidable) that would permit the exclusion of the Parol Evidence Rule to admit such testimony. Simply proving that the check did not clear is not enough to show the deed\u2019s terms were not fulfilled or that the contract was invalid, under the usual parol-evidence framework.\n- If the woman seeks relief, she would generally have to pursue remedies for breach or rescission, but not by admitting this parol evidence as to the payment recital.\n\nIn sum, the proposed testimony to prove that the payment did not occur conflicts with an express term of the writing and is barred by the parol evidence rule."

But it does not bar evidence of nonperformance (breach) to prove what actually happened with respect to the contract.\n- The contract states the sale was for $10,000 and contains a recitation that payment was received. The plaintiff\u2019s proposed testimony\u2014that the buyer did not in fact pay the $10,000 as recited\u2014goes to whether the buyer performed (breached) rather than to alter the price or add terms. Evidence of nonpayment (e.g., the bounced check) is relevant and admissible to prove breach of contract.\n- The fact that the check later did not clear does not make the claim of nonpayment inadmissible; it simply undermines the presumption created by the contract\u2019s payment-receipt language and supports damages or rescission, depending on the relief sought.\n\nIn short, the woman should be allowed to testify that the man did not actually pay the $10,000 (and that the check bounced) as evidence of nonperformance. The court should not sustain the objection on parol-evidence grounds."

A witness attempting to testify that the buyer did not actually pay the stated $10,000 would be trying to negate or contradict the contract\u2019s express terms (the price and the receipt of payment) rather than merely explaining those terms.\n- Therefore, the woman\u2019s proposed testimony that the buyer did not in fact pay $10,000 would be inadmissible as improper attempt to vary the terms of an integrated writing.\n- Note: If the issue were framed as a defense to enforcement (e.g., lack of consideration) or as a separate fraud/misrepresentation claim, different evidentiary rules could apply. But on the specific point of admissibility of testimony contradicting the contract\u2019s stated payment term, the parol evidence rule supports exclusion.\n\nPractical alternative:\n- The seller may still prove breach by showing that payment did not clear (e.g., via bank records, canceled checks) as part of proving breach of contract or seeking damages or rescission, but such evidence would not be admissible to show that the contract\u2019s payment term was not part of the contract itself; instead, it would be used to prove the contract was not performed or to support a remedy."

The parties\u2019 contract for the sale of land was reduced to a writing that states the price ($10,000) and includes a recital that the \u201creceipt of [the] $10,000\u201d is acknowledged.

Under the parol evidence rule, extrinsic evidence cannot be admitted to contradict the terms of a fully integrated writing.\n\n- The proper way to address nonpayment, if any, is either:\n  - to treat it as a breach of contract and seek damages (or rescission if appropriate), with the check\u2019s bounce evidence admissible as proof of breach or damages, not as a contrary statement about the contract\u2019s terms; or\n  - to pursue any independent claims (e.g., fraud) only if a separate misrepresentation or concealment occurred, which would require its own proof.\n\n- If the writing is truly unambiguous and integrated, evidence about whether payment actually occurred cannot be admitted to show that the price was not paid, because that would contradict the contract\u2019s explicit terms.\n\nThere is a potential caveat: if the writing were not fully integrated or if the terms were ambiguous, or if there were a separate claim (e.g., fraud) independent of the contract\u2019s terms, then extrinsic evidence might be admissible. But on the stated facts, the court should exclude the testimony about nonpayment."

The issue is whether the buyer actually performed (paid) as promised. That is a matter of performance or breach, not of contradicting or varying the terms of the contract.\n- The parol evidence rule generally bars evidence of extrinsic agreements that alter or vary the terms of a written, integrated contract. It does not bar evidence of later nonperformance or a breach of the contract. Evidence that the buyer did not actually pay (e.g., a dishonored check) is relevant to prove breach and to support damages.\n- The bank\u2019s notice that the check did not clear is admissible as proof of nonpayment, and the witness\u2019s testimony that payment did not in fact occur would be relevant to the breach claim. It does not modify the contract\u2019s price or other terms; it simply shows the contract was not performed as promised.\n- In short, the fact of nonpayment is a post-signing event used to prove breach, not an attempt to vary or contradict the written contract.

Recitals of Fact vs. Contractual Terms\nThe Parol Evidence Rule generally prohibits the introduction of extrinsic evidence (oral or written) that contradicts the terms of a fully integrated written agreement. However, a statement in a contract such as \"receipt of which is hereby acknowledged\" is considered a **recital of fact**, not a contractual term or a promise. \n\nUnder the law of evidence and contracts, recitals of fact are not conclusive. Extrinsic evidence is almost always admissible to contradict a recital of fact. Therefore, the woman is permitted to testify that, despite the written statement, the money was never actually received.\n\n### 2. Failure of Consideration\nThe woman is seeking to prove a **failure of consideration**. Evidence is always admissible to show that the consideration for a contract was never paid or that the check provided at closing was dishonored. Because the payment of the purchase price is a fundamental requirement for the performance of the contract, the woman has the right to show that the man breached the agreement by providing a check with insufficient funds.\n\n### 3. The \"True Consideration\" Exception\nMost jurisdictions recognize a specific exception to the Parol Evidence Rule for the \"true consideration.\" Parties are permitted to introduce extrinsic evidence to show what the actual consideration was, or that the consideration recited in the deed or contract was not, in fact, paid.\n\n### Conclusion\nBecause the woman\u2019s testimony goes to the **fact of payment** (a recital) and a **failure of consideration**, it is not barred by the Parol Evidence Rule. The judge should allow the testimony so the woman can prove the man's breach of contract."

The Nature of the Recital**\nThe Parol Evidence Rule (PER) generally prohibits the admission of extrinsic evidence (prior or contemporaneous oral or written statements) that contradicts or varies the terms of a fully integrated written agreement. However, there is a long-standing distinction between **contractual terms** and **recitals of fact**. \n\nA statement in a contract or deed that says \"receipt of which is hereby acknowledged\" is considered a mere recital of fact (essentially a receipt) rather than a contractual term or a promise. Because it is a statement of fact about something that has supposedly already happened, rather than a term of the legal agreement itself, the PER does not bar evidence to contradict it.\n\n**2. Failure of Consideration**\nEven if a contract is fully integrated, the Parol Evidence Rule does not prevent a party from introducing evidence to show that the consideration was never actually paid. Evidence is always admissible to show:\n*   That a contract is void or voidable (e.g., due to fraud, mistake, or duress).\n*   That there was a **failure of consideration**.\n\nIf the man\u2019s check bounced, the consideration for the transfer failed. The woman is permitted to testify to this fact to prove that the man breached the contract, regardless of what the written instrument states regarding the receipt of funds.\n\n**3. Application to the Case**\nIn this scenario, the woman is not trying to change the price of the land or add new conditions to the sale (which would likely be barred by the PER). She is simply testifying to the fact that, despite the written acknowledgment, the money was never actually received because the check was dishonored.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe judge should **overrule** the objection. The woman's testimony is admissible to rebut the recital of fact and to prove the man's breach of contract through failure of consideration."

The \"Recital of Consideration\" Exception:**\nThe man\u2019s objection is likely based on the fact that the written instrument explicitly states receipt of the $10,000 is acknowledged. However, the law distinguishes between \"contractual terms\" and \"recitals of fact.\" \n\nIn most jurisdictions, a **recital of consideration** (a statement that payment has been received) is treated as a mere receipt and not a contractual term. Because it is a statement of fact rather than a promise or a legal obligation, the Parol Evidence Rule does not bar extrinsic evidence offered to show that the consideration was not, in fact, paid.\n\n**3. Failure of Consideration:**\nFurthermore, parol evidence is always admissible to show **failure of consideration**. Since the check the man provided was returned for insufficient funds, the woman is entitled to show that the man breached the contract by failing to provide the agreed-upon value. The \"receipt\" in the contract does not prevent the seller from proving that the \"payment\" (the check) was ultimately worthless.\n\n### Conclusion\nA recital of payment in a contract for the sale of land is evidentiary but not conclusive. The woman is permitted to testify that she never actually received the funds to rebut the written recital and to prove the man's breach of contract. Therefore, the judge should **overrule** the objection."

Under the law of evidence and contracts, recitals of fact are generally not subject to the Parol Evidence Rule.\n\n**3. Admissibility to Prove Non-Payment:**\nWhile the written instrument provides *prima facie* evidence that the money was paid, it is not conclusive. Courts allow parties to introduce extrinsic evidence to:\n*   Contradict a recital of fact.\n*   Show that the consideration was never actually paid (failure of consideration).\n*   Show that the actual consideration was different from what was stated.\n\n**4. Application to the Case:**\nIn this scenario, the woman is seeking to testify that the $10,000 payment mentioned in the writing was never actually fulfilled because the check was returned for insufficient funds. Because this testimony contradicts a factual recital (the receipt of money) rather than a substantive term of the agreement (the price of the land), the Parol Evidence Rule does not apply.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe woman's testimony is admissible to show that the man breached the contract by failing to provide the agreed-upon consideration. Therefore, the judge should **overrule** the objection and allow the testimony."

The Parol Evidence Rule Exception\nThe man\u2019s objection is likely based on the **Parol Evidence Rule**, which generally prohibits the introduction of extrinsic evidence (prior or contemporaneous statements) that contradicts or varies the terms of a final, integrated written agreement.\n\nHowever, there is a long-standing and universally recognized exception to this rule: **the Parol Evidence Rule does not apply to recitals of consideration.** While the written instrument states that the $10,000 was received, this is considered a \"recital of fact\" rather than a contractual term. Courts allow parties to introduce extrinsic evidence to show that the consideration recited in a contract or deed was not, in fact, paid.\n\n### 2. Recital of Consideration vs. Contractual Term\nIn contract law, a statement such as \"receipt of which is acknowledged\" is treated as a mere receipt. A receipt is evidence of payment, but it is not conclusive. The woman is not trying to change the *amount* of the price (which might be a protected term) but rather trying to prove the **fact** that the payment she was entitled to under the contract was never actually delivered.\n\n### 3. Failure of Consideration\nThe woman is testifying to a **failure of consideration**. Evidence is always admissible to show that a contract is unenforceable or has been breached because the consideration promised was never provided. Since the check was returned for insufficient funds, the man failed to perform his end of the bargain. The Parol Evidence Rule never bars evidence offered to show that a party failed to perform their obligations.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nBecause the recital of payment is not an integrated \"term\" of the contract but a rebuttable statement of fact, the woman is permitted to testify that she did not actually receive the money. Therefore, the judge would be in error to sustain the objection and exclude her testimony."

The objection should be overruled, and the woman\u2019s testimony should be admitted.\n\nThe legal reasoning is based on the application of the **Parol Evidence Rule** and its exceptions regarding the recital of consideration.\n\n### 1. The Parol Evidence Rule (PER)\nGenerally, the Parol Evidence Rule prevents the introduction of extrinsic evidence (oral or written) that contradicts or varies the terms of a final, integrated written agreement. The man is likely arguing that the written contract explicitly states that the $10,000 was received, and therefore the woman's testimony contradicts the \"plain meaning\" of the contract.\n\n### 2. The Exception: Recital of Consideration\nThe law distinguishes between the **terms** of a contract (the promises made) and a **recital of fact** (a statement about something that has already happened). \n\nA statement in a contract such as \"receipt of which is hereby acknowledged\" is considered a mere recital of fact. It is not a contractual term that the Parol Evidence Rule protects from contradiction. Under the law of evidence and contracts:\n*   **Parol evidence is admissible to show that the consideration recited in a contract was not, in fact, paid.** \n*   While the writing serves as *prima facie* evidence that the money was paid, it is not conclusive. The parties are permitted to introduce evidence to prove that the payment never occurred or that the check used for payment was dishonored.\n\n### 3. Failure of Consideration\nFurthermore, the woman is seeking to prove a **failure of consideration**. Because the man\u2019s check was returned for insufficient funds, he has failed to perform his side of the contract. Parol evidence is always admissible to show that a contract is void or voidable due to a failure of consideration, fraud, or mistake.\n\n### 4. The Nature of a Check\nUnder the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) and general contract principles, a check is considered \"conditional payment.\" When a seller accepts a check, the obligation to pay is suspended until the check is presented for payment. If the check is dishonored (bounces), the suspension ends, and the seller may sue either on the check or on the underlying obligation (the $10,000 debt).\n\n### Conclusion\nBecause the woman is testifying to a fact (non-payment) rather than trying to change the terms of the agreement (e.g., claiming the price was $15,000 instead of $10,000), the Parol Evidence Rule does not apply. The judge should allow the testimony."

The PER generally prohibits the introduction of extrinsic evidence (oral or written) made prior to or contemporaneous with a written agreement that contradicts or varies the terms of a \"fully integrated\" writing.\n\nHowever, there are several established exceptions to the Parol Evidence Rule that apply in this scenario:\n\n1.  **Recitals of Fact:** The Parol Evidence Rule applies to the *terms* of a contract (the promises and obligations), but it generally does not apply to **recitals of fact**. A statement in a contract such as \"receipt of which is hereby acknowledged\" is considered a recital of fact\u2014effectively a receipt. Like any other receipt, it is evidence that payment occurred, but it is not conclusive. A party is permitted to introduce extrinsic evidence to show that the fact recited is actually untrue (i.e., that the money was never delivered).\n\n2.  **Failure of Consideration:** Extrinsic evidence is always admissible to show that the consideration for a contract was never paid.

In most jurisdictions, a recital of consideration (e.g., \"receipt of which is hereby acknowledged\") is considered a mere receipt. \n\nUnder the law of evidence and contracts, a receipt is not a contractual term but a statement of fact.

The \"Check\" as Conditional Payment\nUnder general contract law (and the Uniform Commercial Code, which provides persuasive authority here), payment by check is considered **conditional payment**. This means that the obligation to pay is not discharged until the check actually clears the bank. Since the check was returned for insufficient funds, the underlying obligation to pay the $10,000 remains. The woman is entitled to prove that the \"receipt\" acknowledged in the writing was not realized because the check was dishonored.\n\n### 4.

Courts allow parties to introduce extrinsic evidence to show that the consideration recited in a contract or deed was not, in fact, paid.\n\n### 2. Recital of Consideration vs. Contractual Term\nIn contract law, a statement such as \"receipt of which is acknowledged\" is treated as a mere receipt. A receipt is evidence of payment, but it is not conclusive. The woman is not trying to change the *amount* of the price (which might be a protected term) but rather trying to prove the **fact** that the payment she was entitled to under the contract was never actually delivered.\n\n### 3. Failure of Consideration\nThe woman is testifying to a **failure of consideration**. Evidence is always admissible to show that a contract is unenforceable or has been breached because the consideration promised was never provided. Since the check was returned for insufficient funds, the man failed to perform his end of the bargain. The Parol Evidence Rule never bars evidence offered to show that a party failed to perform their obligations.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nBecause the recital of payment is not an integrated \"term\" of the contract but a rebuttable statement of fact, the woman is permitted to testify that she did not actually receive the money. Therefore, the judge would be in error to sustain the objection and exclude her testimony."

The Parol Evidence Rule and Recitals of Consideration\nThe man\u2019s objection is likely based on the **Parol Evidence Rule (PER)**, which generally prohibits the introduction of extrinsic evidence (oral or written) that contradicts or varies the terms of a fully integrated written contract.\n\nHowever, a well-established exception to the Parol Evidence Rule applies to **recitals of consideration**. A statement in a written contract that consideration has been received (e.g., \"receipt of which is hereby acknowledged\") is generally treated as a mere **receipt**\u2014a statement of fact\u2014rather than a contractual term. \n\n### 2. Fact vs. Contractual Term\nUnder the law of evidence and contracts, a receipt is not an integrated part of the agreement. Therefore, the Parol Evidence Rule does not bar extrinsic evidence offered to show that the recited consideration was not, in fact, paid. Most jurisdictions allow a party to show that the consideration was never received, even if the written instrument says it was.\n\n### 3. Failure of Consideration\nFurthermore, the woman is seeking to prove a **failure of consideration**. Evidence is always admissible to show that a contract is unenforceable or has been breached because the promised consideration was never delivered. Since the check was returned for insufficient funds, the woman has the right to prove that the man failed to perform his end of the bargain.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nBecause the statement \". . . receipt of which is acknowledged\" is a recital of fact and not a binding contractual term that prohibits contradiction, the woman\u2019s testimony is admissible to show the actual truth of the transaction.\n\n**The judge should overrule the objection.**"

Failure of Consideration\nThe woman is seeking to prove **failure of consideration**. In contract law, evidence is always admissible to show that the consideration required to support the contract was never actually delivered. If the man\u2019s check was returned for insufficient funds, the consideration failed. The Parol Evidence Rule does not bar evidence that goes to the validity of the contract or the performance of its conditions.\n\n### 3. The Check as Conditional Payment\nUnder the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) and general contract principles, payment by check is \"conditional.\" This means that the payment is only considered absolute once the check is honored by the bank. When the check was dishonored (bounced), the condition was not met, and the woman has the right to sue for the underlying debt or for breach of contract.\n\n### 4. Integration\nEven if the contract was intended to be a \"total integration\" of the parties' agreement, the PER only protects the **terms** of the agreement (the promises made). It does not prevent a party from proving that a factual statement in the document (the receipt of money) is incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\nBecause the woman is testifying to a factual inaccuracy regarding the receipt of funds and a failure of consideration, the Parol Evidence Rule does not apply. The judge should **overrule** the objection and allow the testimony."

It creates a rebuttable presumption that payment was made, but extrinsic evidence is admissible to prove that the money was not actually received.\n\nTherefore, the woman is permitted to testify that the check bounced and she was not paid, and the judge should overrule the man's objection."

          "text": "Based on general principles of property and contract law, the answer is **No**.\n\nHere is the detailed reasoning:\n\n**The Legal Issue: The Parol Evidence Rule**\nThe man is likely objecting based on the **Parol Evidence Rule**. This rule generally prevents parties from introducing extrinsic evidence (oral or written evidence outside the contract) to contradict, vary, or add to the terms of a fully integrated written agreement. The man argues that because the deed says \"receipt... is acknowledged,\" the woman cannot testify that she *didn't* receive the money, as that would contradict the written document.\n\n**The Exception: Recitals of Consideration**\nHowever, there is a well-established exception to the Parol Evidence Rule regarding **recitals of consideration**.\n\n1.  **Receipts are not binding terms:** A statement in a deed or contract that money has been received (e.g., \"$10,000, receipt of which is acknowledged\") is viewed by the courts as a mere **receipt** or a statement of fact, rather than a contractual term.\n2.  **Rebuttable presumption:** While the written acknowledgment creates a presumption that payment was made, it is not conclusive.\n3.  **Admissibility:** Extrinsic evidence is **admissible** to show that the consideration recited in a deed was not actually paid.\n\n**Application to the Facts**\nThe woman is not trying to invalidate the deed or argue that the conveyance of the land never happened. Instead, she is suing to recover the purchase price (or potentially rescind based on a total failure of consideration). Because the statement acknowledging receipt is just a statement of fact and not a binding contractual term, the Parol Evidence Rule does not bar her from telling the truth: that the check bounced and the consideration was never actually received.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe trial court judge would be **incorrect** in sustaining the objection. The objection should be **overruled**, and the woman should be permitted to testify that she was not paid."

This testimony is extrinsic evidence that directly contradicts the terms of the written instrument regarding the receipt of $10,000.\n\n## Step 4: Apply the Parol Evidence Rule to the Woman's Testimony\nThe parol evidence rule prohibits the introduction of extrinsic evidence that contradicts the terms of a written contract.

However, the man had not actually paid the $10,000 at the time of signing. The woman is now seeking to testify that the man did not pay her the $10,000 as stated in their written instrument.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the Parol Evidence Rule to the Situation\nThe parol evidence rule generally bars extrinsic evidence that contradicts or modifies the terms of a written contract. However, there are exceptions to this rule, including the ability to introduce evidence to show that a condition precedent to the contract's effectiveness did not occur.\n\n## Step 4: Determine if the Payment is a Condition Precedent\nThe statement \"receipt of which is acknowledged\" suggests that the payment was acknowledged at the time of the agreement. However, the context implies that this was not a condition precedent to the contract's formation but rather an acknowledgment of payment that did not actually occur. The woman's testimony is not attempting to vary the terms of the contract but rather to show that the condition (payment) that was acknowledged to have been received was not actually fulfilled.\n\n## Step 5: Consider the Exception to the Parol Evidence Rule for Conditions Precedent\nThe parol evidence rule does not bar testimony concerning the nonoccurrence of a condition precedent to a contract's effectiveness. The woman's testimony is aimed at showing that the payment, which was acknowledged in the writing, was not actually made. This can be seen as showing the nonoccurrence of a condition (actual payment) rather than directly contradicting the terms of the contract.\n\n## Step 6: Evaluate the Man's Objection\nThe man's objection is based on the parol evidence rule. However, the woman's testimony is not directly contradicting the contract's terms in a way that the parol evidence rule prohibits. Instead, it's about the factual circumstance (payment) that was misrepresented in the writing.\n\n## Step 7: Conclusion\nThe trial court judge will be incorrect in sustaining the man's objection because the woman's testimony is admissible to show that the condition (payment of $10,000) was not met, even though the writing acknowledged its receipt.

The woman and the man signed a writing stating that the $10,000 was received, but the man's check bounced due to insufficient funds.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the legal issue at hand\nThe legal issue here is whether the woman can testify that the man did not pay her the $10,000, despite the written instrument stating that the receipt of $10,000 is acknowledged.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the relevant legal principle\nThe Parol Evidence Rule (PER) generally prohibits the introduction of extrinsic evidence to contradict or modify the terms of a written contract. However, the PER does not bar evidence that is used to show that a contract was never formed or is invalid due to some reason like fraud or failure of consideration.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the specific rule related to the acknowledgment of payment\nWhen a writing acknowledges payment, the acknowledgment is considered an admission against the interest of the party making it (in this case, the woman). However, the rule that an acknowledgment of payment in a written instrument can be contradicted by parol evidence is an exception related to the issue of payment, not the terms of the contract itself.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the applicability of the rule to the given situation\nThe statement \". . . for $10,000, receipt of which is acknowledged\" is a recital of payment. Generally, parol evidence is admissible to show that a recital of payment in a deed or other written instrument is not true.\n\n## Step 6: Consider the man's objection and the trial court's decision\nThe man objects to the woman's testimony regarding non-payment. The trial court will sustain the objection if it believes the Parol Evidence Rule prohibits the introduction of this testimony.\n\n## Step 7: Apply the relevant law to the facts\nThe Parol Evidence Rule does not bar testimony that contradicts a recital of payment in a deed. Such testimony is admissible to show that the payment was not made as stated.\n\n## Step 8: Conclude based on the analysis\nGiven that parol evidence can be used to contradict a recital of payment, the woman should be allowed to testify that she did not receive the $10,000.\n\n## Step 9: Determine the correctness of the trial court's decision\nThe trial court judge will be incorrect in sustaining the man's objection because the woman's testimony is admissible to contradict the recital of payment.\n\nThe best answer is No."

The writing stated that the farmland was being sold for $10,000, with an acknowledgment of receipt. However, the man had not actually paid the $10,000 at the time of signing.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the legal issue at hand\nThe issue revolves around whether the woman can testify that the man did not pay her the $10,000 as stated in their written agreement, despite the writing acknowledging receipt of the payment.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the Parol Evidence Rule\nThe Parol Evidence Rule generally prohibits the introduction of extrinsic evidence to contradict or modify the terms of a written contract that is intended to be a complete and final expression of the parties' agreement. However, there are exceptions, such as when the extrinsic evidence is used to prove fraud, duress, or other grounds for voiding the contract, or when it is used to clarify an ambiguity.\n\n## Step 4: Consider the specific rule regarding acknowledgment of payment\nWhen a written instrument acknowledges receipt of payment, the Parol Evidence Rule allows for the introduction of extrinsic evidence to show that the payment was not actually made. This is because the acknowledgment of receipt is considered a statement of fact that can be contradicted by parol evidence.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze the man's objection and the woman's testimony\nThe man objects to the woman's testimony about non-payment. According to the rule mentioned in Step 4, the woman should be allowed to testify that the man did not pay her, as this testimony contradicts the acknowledgment of receipt in the writing.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the correctness of sustaining the man's objection\nGiven that the Parol Evidence Rule allows for extrinsic evidence to contradict an acknowledgment of payment, the trial court judge would be incorrect in sustaining the man's objection to the woman's testimony regarding the non-payment of $10,000.\n\nThe best answer is No."

However, the parol evidence rule does not bar evidence that shows a contract was never formed or that the contract is invalid due to fraud, duress, etc. Moreover, the parol evidence rule allows for the introduction of evidence to show that a contract was not supported by consideration or that the consideration was different from what was stated.\n\n## Step 4: Analyze the specific scenario regarding the payment and the written acknowledgment\nThe writing between the woman and the man includes a statement that acknowledges receipt of $10,000. However, this acknowledgment is not necessarily conclusive evidence of payment. The issue is whether the woman can introduce testimony to contradict the acknowledgment of receipt.\n\n## Step 5: Determine the applicability of the parol evidence rule to the acknowledgment of payment\nThe parol evidence rule distinguishes between statements that are contractual (operative) and those that are merely recitals or acknowledgments. An acknowledgment of receipt is considered a statement of fact. Generally, parol evidence is admissible to show that an acknowledgment of payment is not true.\n\n## Step 6: Apply the relevant rule to the given situation\nIn this case, the woman is seeking to testify that she did not receive the $10,000, contradicting the acknowledgment of receipt in the writing.

They had signed a written agreement stating that the farmland was being sold for $10,000, with the receipt of the payment acknowledged. However, the man had not actually paid the $10,000 at the time of signing.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the legal issue at hand\nThe legal issue here revolves around the admissibility of the woman's testimony regarding the non-payment of $10,000 by the man, despite the written agreement stating that the payment was received.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the Parol Evidence Rule\nThe Parol Evidence Rule is a substantive rule of law that prohibits the introduction of evidence of prior or contemporaneous negotiations or agreements that contradict, modify, or vary contractual terms expressed in a written document intended by the parties to be a complete and final expression of their agreement.\n\n## Step 4: Determine if the written agreement is a complete integration\nThe written agreement between the woman and the man appears to be a contract for the sale of the farmland. The statement \". . . for $10,000, receipt of which is acknowledged\" is a part of this contract. The key issue is whether this writing is considered a complete integration of their agreement.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze the effect of the Parol Evidence Rule on the woman's testimony\nThe Parol Evidence Rule generally bars extrinsic evidence (like the woman's testimony) that contradicts the terms of a written contract. However, there's an exception for evidence that explains or clarifies an ambiguity, or for certain types of evidence like proof of fraud, duress, or failure of consideration.\n\n## Step 6: Consider the specific language of the contract and its implications\nThe contract states \"receipt of which is acknowledged,\" which is a recital of fact regarding payment. The Parol Evidence Rule does not bar evidence that contradicts a recital of fact if the recital is not a term of the contract but rather a statement of fact that can be proven to be false.\n\n## Step 7: Apply the rule regarding recitals of fact in contracts\nRecitals of fact, such as \"receipt of which is acknowledged,\" can be challenged with extrinsic evidence. The woman's testimony that the man did not pay the $10,000 is extrinsic evidence that directly contradicts the recital of fact in the contract.\n\n## Step 8: Determine the admissibility of the woman's testimony\nGiven that the statement about receiving $10,000 is a recital of fact and not a contractual term, the woman should be allowed to testify that the man did not pay her. The Parol Evidence Rule does not bar testimony that contradicts a recital of fact.\n\n## Step 9: Conclude on the correctness of sustaining the man's objection\nThe trial court judge would be incorrect in sustaining the man's objection to the woman's testimony because the Parol Evidence Rule does not prohibit testimony that contradicts a recital of fact.\n\nThe best answer is No."

The writing acknowledged receipt of $10,000, but the man had not actually paid this amount at the time of signing. The woman later received a check for $10,000 at the closing, which bounced due to insufficient funds.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the legal issue at hand\nThe issue revolves around whether the woman can testify that the man did not pay her $10,000 as stated in their written agreement. The man's objection to her testimony is based on the parol evidence rule, which generally prohibits the introduction of extrinsic evidence to contradict or modify the terms of a written contract.\n\n## Step 3: Apply the parol evidence rule\nThe parol evidence rule states that when a written contract is intended to be a complete and final expression of the parties' agreement (an integrated contract), evidence of prior or contemporaneous negotiations or agreements is not admissible to vary the terms of the contract. However, the rule does allow for the introduction of extrinsic evidence to prove that the contract was not validly formed (e.g., due to fraud, duress) or to clarify ambiguities.\n\n## Step 4: Consider the exception for proving non-payment or failure of consideration\nThere's an important exception relevant to this case: extrinsic evidence can be used to show that a statement in a written contract (like an acknowledgment of payment) is false. This is because the parol evidence rule does not bar evidence that shows a lack or failure of consideration.\n\n## Step 5: Analyze the specific writing and the woman's testimony\nThe writing between the woman and the man includes the phrase \". . . for $10,000, receipt of which is acknowledged.\" The woman seeks to testify that she did not receive $10,000, contradicting the acknowledgment of receipt in the writing. This testimony is aimed at showing that the consideration (payment of $10,000) was not actually received.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the admissibility of the woman's testimony\nThe parol evidence rule does not bar testimony that challenges the truth of a statement within a contract, such as an acknowledgment of payment. The woman's testimony is not attempting to vary the terms of the contract but rather to show that the acknowledgment of payment was false, indicating a failure of consideration.\n\n## Step 7: Conclude based on the analysis\nGiven that the woman's testimony is intended to show that the acknowledgment of receipt was false, it falls under an exception to the parol evidence rule. Thus, the trial court judge should overrule the man's objection and allow the woman to testify.\n\n## Step 8: Address the question directly\nThe question asks whether the trial court judge will be correct in sustaining the man's objection. Based on the analysis, sustaining the objection would be incorrect because the woman's testimony is admissible to show that the acknowledgment of payment was false.\n\nThe best answer is No."

The parol evidence rule does not prevent proof that consideration was not actually executed.\n\nConclusion:\nThe trial court judge would NOT be correct in sustaining the man's objection. The woman should be allowed to testify that the $10,000 was not actually paid, as this goes to the factual performance of the contract, not its written terms.\n\nThe woman's testimony would be admissible to show that the contractual condition of payment was not met."

          "text": "Let's analyze this issue step by step using the parol evidence rule:\n\n1. Parol Evidence Rule Basics:\n- The parol evidence rule generally prevents parties from introducing external evidence that contradicts or modifies a written contract's terms when the writing is intended to be the final, complete agreement.\n\n2. Analyzing the Situation:\n- The written agreement states \"$10,000, receipt of which is acknowledged\"\n- In reality, no payment was made at the time of signing\n- The check subsequently bounced\n\n3. Key Considerations:\n- The written statement \"receipt of which is acknowledged\" appears to be a clear assertion of payment\n- This could be viewed as an integration clause suggesting the writing is a complete and final agreement\n\n4. Exception to Parol Evidence Rule:\n- Fraud is a recognized exception to the parol evidence rule\n- The woman is attempting to prove the man did not actually pay the $10,000 as represented in the writing\n\n5. Conclusion:\n- The trial court judge would likely be INCORRECT in sustaining the man's objection\n- The woman should be allowed to testify about the lack of actual payment\n- This testimony goes to the issue of fraud in the formation of the contract\n\nThe court would likely permit the testimony to investigate whether fraudulent misrepresentation occurred when the contract was executed."

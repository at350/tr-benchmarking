    "question": "A husband and wife were shopping at a local department store when the wife saw a dress that she especially liked. The wife, who weighed more than 300 pounds, was unable to find a size large enough to fit her. She then saw a store clerk and asked if the store carried the dress in her size. The clerk looked at the wife and said, \"You look like a hippopotamus, and I'm sorry, but we don't carry this dress in the hippo size. \" Another customer in the store overheard the comment and began to laugh. The wife became very upset and hurried out of the store. If the wife asserts a tort action against the department store based upon the clerk's actions, the wife will\n\n\"win, because the clerk's actions caused her emotional distress.\",\n\"lose, because the wife did not suffer any physical harm.\",\n\"win, because the comment was intended to ridicule and humiliate her.\",\n\"lose, because the comment was made in a public place.\",\n\"win, because the store does not carry clothes in her size.\",\n\"lose, because the wife only suffered hurt feelings.\",\n\"win, because the statement was overheard by another customer.\",\n\"win, because the clerk's conduct was extreme and outrageous.\",\n\"lose, because the comment was not intended to cause harm.\",\n\"lose, because the clerk was merely stating an opinion.\"\n",

          "issue": "Whether the wife can successfully assert a tort claim against the department store for intentional infliction of emotional distress based on the clerk's insulting comments about her weight and size.",
          "rule": "To establish intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED), a plaintiff must prove: (1) the defendant engaged in extreme and outrageous conduct; (2) the defendant intended to cause severe emotional distress or acted with reckless disregard as to whether such distress would result; (3) the plaintiff suffered severe emotional distress; and (4) the defendant's conduct was the actual and proximate cause of that distress. Conduct is considered extreme and outrageous when it exceeds all bounds of decency tolerated in a civilized society. The employer is vicariously liable for torts committed by employees acting within the scope of employment. Physical injury is not required for IIED claims, though severe emotional distress must be demonstrated. The presence of third parties who witness the conduct can strengthen a claim by evidencing public humiliation.",
          "application": "The clerk, acting within the scope of employment as a store employee assisting customers, compared the wife to a hippopotamus and stated the store does not carry dresses in 'hippo size.' This conduct was deliberately insulting and humiliating. Calling a customer a hippopotamus in front of other shoppers constitutes extreme and outrageous conduct that exceeds acceptable bounds of workplace interaction. The clerk's statement was intentionally directed at the wife with apparent intent to mock her physical appearance. Another customer overheard and laughed, compounding the public humiliation. The wife became very upset and hurried from the store, demonstrating emotional distress. While the facts do not explicitly state 'severe' emotional distress with medical evidence, the public nature of the humiliation and the wife's visible reaction support the claim. No physical harm is required for IIED. The department store is vicariously liable for its clerk's tortious conduct.",
          "conclusion": "Win, because the clerk's conduct was extreme and outrageous."

The facts also indicate the wife became upset and left the store, but they do not show distress of the required severity (e.g., ongoing psychological harm, medical treatment, inability to function). While intent to humiliate can be inferred from the phrasing, IIED requires more than intent to ridicule; it requires extreme and outrageous conduct and severe distress. Therefore, the wife is unlikely to satisfy the \u201cextreme and outrageous\u201d and \u201csevere distress\u201d elements, even though no physical harm is required and the public nature/overhearing does not itself create liability.",
          "conclusion": "The wife will likely lose, because the clerk\u2019s comment is generally treated as a mere insult causing hurt feelings rather than extreme and outrageous conduct producing legally \u201csevere\u201d emotional distress."

          "issue": "Whether the wife can recover against the department store for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) based on the clerk\u2019s humiliating comment about her weight and size in front of others.",
          "rule": "To prove IIED, a plaintiff must show: (1) the defendant engaged in extreme and outrageous conduct; (2) the defendant acted intentionally or recklessly as to causing emotional distress; (3) the conduct caused the plaintiff\u2019s distress; and (4) the distress was severe. Physical injury is not required. Mere insults or hurt feelings generally are insufficient unless the circumstances (including abuse of a position of power, known special susceptibility, or public humiliation) make the conduct extreme and outrageous. An employer can be vicariously liable for an employee\u2019s tort committed within the scope of employment.",
          "application": "The clerk, while acting as a store employee responding to a customer request, compared the wife to a \u201chippopotamus\u201d and mocked her as needing a \u201chippo size,\u201d an intentional ridicule tied directly to a personal characteristic (her weight) and delivered in a customer-service setting. The fact that another customer overheard and laughed supports the humiliating nature of the incident and helps show outrageousness beyond a private, offhand remark. The wife immediately became very upset and fled the store, supporting causation and emotional distress; and IIED does not require physical harm. While isolated insults often do not meet the high threshold, a targeted, degrading, customer-facing humiliation by a clerk can be found extreme and outrageous, and the clerk at least acted recklessly (if not intentionally) regarding the likelihood of causing severe distress. The store may be liable under respondeat superior because the interaction occurred during the clerk\u2019s performance of job duties (assisting a customer).",
          "conclusion": "The wife is most likely to win on an IIED theory because the clerk\u2019s conduct can be deemed extreme and outrageous and was at least reckless in causing severe emotional distress; physical harm is not required."

Mere insults, indignities, or hurt feelings\u2014without conduct that is truly extreme and outrageous\u2014are generally insufficient.

          "application": "The clerk\u2019s remark was rude, humiliating, and directed at the wife\u2019s appearance in a customer-service setting, and it caused her to become very upset and leave. However, courts usually treat isolated name-calling and mocking comments in retail interactions as \"mere insults\" rather than the kind of extreme and outrageous conduct required for IIED, absent additional aggravating circumstances (e.g., a pattern of harassment, abuse of special power over a vulnerable person, threats, or truly egregious conduct). The fact that another customer overheard and laughed can increase the humiliation, but it typically does not transform a single insulting comment into actionable IIED. The facts also indicate upset and embarrassment, but do not clearly show the level of \u201csevere\u201d emotional distress required.

The facts also describe that the wife became upset and left, but do not indicate \u201csevere\u201d emotional distress (e.g., medical treatment, inability to function, prolonged symptoms).

Under the general rule that mere insults and public ridicule, standing alone, are not \u201cextreme and outrageous\u201d and do not establish \u201csevere\u201d distress, the claim would likely fail.

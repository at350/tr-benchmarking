    "question": "When a woman's dog went missing, she posted missing-dog fliers around the neighborhood. The fliers offered a $200 reward for anyone who returned the dog to her. The next day, a man walking in the neighborhood saw the dog and recognized it as belonging to the woman. The man took the dog to the woman's house and returned it to her. Neither party made any mention of the reward. Later that afternoon, the man saw one of the missing-dog fliers for the first time. Upset that the woman did not pay him $200, he went back to her house and demanded the money.\n\nIs the woman obligated to pay the man the $200 reward?\n\nYes, because the reward offer invited performance as a valid acceptance.\nNo, because the reward required pre-notification to potential claimants.\nYes, because returning the dog created an implied contract for the reward.\nNo, because the reward was intended to be valid only for verified witnesses.\nNo, because the fliers did not specifically target the man as the intended offeree.\nNo, because the man did not know of the reward offer at the time he returned the dog.\nNo, because the fliers only offered the reward for returning a lost item.\nYes, because public reward offers become binding upon the act of service.\nYes, because the man\u2019s return of the dog fulfilled the reward offer conditions.\nYes, because the woman received the benefit of the man\u2019s service of returning her dog.",

          "rule": "In contract law, a unilateral contract is formed when an offer invites performance, and the performance of the requested act constitutes acceptance. For a reward offer to be binding, the performer must have knowledge of the reward at the time of performance or a reasonable opportunity to learn of it before performance.",
          "application": "The man returned the dog before he was aware of the reward offer. He did not know about the $200 reward when he initially returned the dog, and only learned of it later that afternoon. The offer was a public notice, but the man's performance was not motivated by the reward. The essential element of intent to claim the reward at the time of performance was missing. Moreover, neither party mentioned the reward when the dog was returned, suggesting no mutual understanding of the reward terms at that time.",
          "conclusion": "No, the woman is not obligated to pay the $200 reward. The man did not perform the act of returning the dog with knowledge of or intent to claim the reward, which is a critical requirement for enforcing a unilateral contract reward offer."

          "rule": "Under contract law, a unilateral contract is formed when an offer of reward is made to the public, and the reward can be claimed by anyone who performs the specified act. To create a valid contract, the performer must have known of the reward offer at the time of performance and must have performed the act in response to the offer.",

He did not know about the $200 reward when he initially returned the dog, and his actions were not motivated by the promise of payment.

          "conclusion": "No, the woman is not obligated to pay the $200 reward. For a unilateral contract to be formed, the performer must have known about the reward offer and acted specifically to claim it. Since the man returned the dog without knowledge of the reward and without intending to claim it, there is no valid contract requiring payment."

          "application": "In this scenario, while the man returned the dog and objectively fulfilled the conditions of the reward offer, he was unaware of the reward at the time he performed the act. The lack of knowledge of the reward offer at the time of performance is a critical factor that typically prevents the formation of a binding contract. The man's actions were motivated by goodwill, not the promise of a reward, and he only learned of the reward after completing the act of returning the dog.",

The man did not have knowledge of the reward offer when he returned the dog, which is a fundamental requirement for claiming a reward. His performance was not done in direct response to the reward offer, and therefore, no binding contract was formed."

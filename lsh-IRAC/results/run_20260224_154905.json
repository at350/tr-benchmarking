    "question": "A man told his neighbor, \u201cIf you will mow my lawn, I will pay you $50.\u201d The neighbor then purchased gasoline for the mower so he could mow the lawn. The neighbor wheeled his lawn mower to the man\u2019s property and started the engine. At that moment, the man suddenly yelled, \u201cI hereby revoke my offer.\u201d If the neighbor thereafter mows the man\u2019s lawn, will he recover the $50?\n\nYes, because the neighbor had begun the task before the man revoked his offer.\nYes, because the neighbor can sue for breach of oral contract.\nNo, because the man revoked his offer before the task was completed.\nNo, because the neighbor had done nothing more than prepare to accept the offer prior to the man\u2019s revocation.\nYes, under the doctrine of quasi-contract.\nYes, because the neighbor had already incurred expenses in preparation to fulfill the contract.\nNo, because the man\u2019s revocation was effective, since the neighbor had not completed performance.\nNo, because the neighbor did not get a written agreement from the man.\nYes, because there was an offer for a unilateral contract that became irrevocable prior to the man\u2019s attempted revocation.\nNo, because there was no written contract and hence no legal obligation for the man to pay.",

          "rule": "In contract law, an offer for a unilateral contract becomes irrevocable once the offeree begins performance. This principle is intended to protect the offeree from the offeror's revocation after they have committed to performing the task based on the offeror's promise.",
          "application": "In this scenario, the neighbor began performance by purchasing gasoline, moving his mower to the man\u2019s property, and starting the mower engine. These actions constitute the beginning of performance under the terms of the unilateral contract offered by the man. According to the rule, once the neighbor began the performance, the man's ability to revoke the offer ceased.",

The neighbor began performance by purchasing gasoline, transporting the lawn mower, and starting the engine on the man's property.

          "application": "In this scenario, the neighbor began to mow the lawn, which constitutes the start of performance on his part.

By starting the lawn mower's engine, the neighbor had commenced performance, which triggers the irrevocability of the unilateral contract offer.",

By starting the lawn mower's engine, the neighbor had initiated the requested act of mowing the lawn.

          "conclusion": "Yes, the neighbor will recover the $50 because he had begun substantial performance of the unilateral contract before the man's attempted revocation, which renders the revocation ineffective. The man is legally obligated to pay the $50 for the lawn mowing service."

          "application": "The neighbor purchased gasoline and physically moved the lawn mower to the property, which constitutes substantial preparation and initial performance of the unilateral contract. The man's attempted revocation comes at the precise moment the neighbor begins performance, which means the offer has already become irrevocable. The neighbor's actions demonstrate a clear intent to fully perform the contract, and he has already incurred expenses in reliance on the offer.",
          "conclusion": "Yes, the neighbor can recover the $50 because the unilateral contract became irrevocable when he began substantial performance, which occurred before the man's attempted revocation. The man cannot unilaterally withdraw the offer once the neighbor has started performing the requested task."

          "conclusion": "Yes, the neighbor would recover the $50 because the unilateral contract became irrevocable when the neighbor started substantial performance before the man's attempted revocation. The correct legal principle is that once substantial performance begins, the offeror cannot unilaterally withdraw the offer, and the offeree is entitled to complete the task and receive promised compensation."

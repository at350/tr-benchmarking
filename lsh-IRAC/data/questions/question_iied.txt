A husband and wife were shopping at a local department store when the wife saw a dress that she especially liked. The wife, who weighed more than 300 pounds, was unable to find a size large enough to fit her. She then saw a store clerk and asked if the store carried the dress in her size. The clerk looked at the wife and said, "You look like a hippopotamus, and I'm sorry, but we don't carry this dress in the hippo size. " Another customer in the store overheard the comment and began to laugh. The wife became very upset and hurried out of the store.

When a woman's dog went missing, she posted missing-dog fliers around the neighborhood. The fliers offered a $200 reward for anyone who returned the dog to her. The next day, a man walking in the neighborhood saw the dog and recognized it as belonging to the woman. The man took the dog to the woman's house and returned it to her. Neither party made any mention of the reward. Later that afternoon, the man saw one of the missing-dog fliers for the first time. Upset that the woman did not pay him $200, he went back to her house and demanded the money.

Is the woman obligated to pay the man the $200 reward?

Yes, because the reward offer invited performance as a valid acceptance.
No, because the reward required pre-notification to potential claimants.
Yes, because returning the dog created an implied contract for the reward.
No, because the reward was intended to be valid only for verified witnesses.
No, because the fliers did not specifically target the man as the intended offeree.
No, because the man did not know of the reward offer at the time he returned the dog.
No, because the fliers only offered the reward for returning a lost item.
Yes, because public reward offers become binding upon the act of service.
Yes, because the man’s return of the dog fulfilled the reward offer conditions.
Yes, because the woman received the benefit of the man’s service of returning her dog.

      "issue": "Whether a customer can recover damages for Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED) against a department store based on an employee's offensive and insulting remarks regarding the customer's weight.",
      "rule": "To establish a prima facie case for Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, the plaintiff must prove: (1) the defendant acted intentionally or recklessly; (2) the conduct was extreme and outrageous; (3) the actions caused the plaintiff emotional distress; and (4) the emotional distress was severe. Liability for IIED does not extend to mere insults, indignities, threats, annoyances, petty oppressions, or other trivialities. 'Severe' emotional distress must go beyond simple embarrassment or hurt feelings; it must be distress so severe that no reasonable person could be expected to endure it.",
      "application": "In this case, the clerk's comment comparing the wife to a 'hippopotamus' was undeniably rude, offensive, and unprofessional. However, under the objective standard of tort law, such insults do not rise to the level of 'extreme and outrageous' conduct required to sustain an IIED claim. Furthermore, the facts state that the wife became 'very upset.' This reaction constitutes 'hurt feelings' rather than the debilitating or severe emotional distress required by law. Unlike common carriers or innkeepers, department stores are not held to a heightened standard of courtesy that would make mere insults actionable.",
      "conclusion": "lose, because the wife only suffered hurt feelings."

    "prompt": "A husband and wife were shopping at a local department store when the wife saw a dress that she especially liked. The wife, who weighed more than 300 pounds, was unable to find a size large enough to fit her. She then saw a store clerk and asked if the store carried the dress in her size. The clerk looked at the wife and said, \"You look like a hippopotamus, and I'm sorry, but we don't carry this dress in the hippo size. \" Another customer in the store overheard the comment and began to laugh. The wife became very upset and hurried out of the store.
